# Antiracist Reading Group

> In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist. --Angela Davis

This is the home page for a reading group in the Purdue math department focused on antiracism, generally in the world at large and specifically in the realms of math and math education. We strive to maintain an inclusive atmosphere for open discussion, personal growth, and active exploration. Total beginners to antiracism are especially welcome, and you don't have to complete every reading every week to participate.

We mostly organize via our mailing list which [you can join here](https://lists.purdue.edu/mailman/listinfo/mathantiracistreading) or by contacting [Patrick DeBonis](mailto:pdebonis@purdue.edu).

In Spring 2023 we are meeting every Thursday in Math room 215 at 4:30. Please feel free to join us, even if you have never come before.

## Next meeting March 30

We will discuss chapters 13 and 14 of [Practices and Policies](https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Policies-Advocating-Students-Mathematics/dp/B09CRW9C3F/),

We will also discuss the article [“It Seems like They Purposefully Try to Make as Many Kids Drop”: An Analysis of Logics and Mechanisms of Racial-Gendered Inequality in Introductory Mathematics Instruction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2021.1879586) by Luis A. Leyva, R. Taylor McNeill, Brittany L. Marshall & Oscar A. Guzmán
