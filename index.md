# Antiracist Reading Group

> In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist. --Angela Davis

This is the home page for a reading group in the Purdue math department focused on antiracism, generally in the world at large and specifically in the realms of math and math education. We strive to maintain an inclusive atmosphere for open discussion, personal growth, and active exploration. Total beginners to antiracism are especially welcome, and you don't have to complete every reading every week to participate.

We mostly organize via our mailing list which [you can join here](https://lists.purdue.edu/mailman/listinfo/mathantiracistreading) or by contacting [Patrick DeBonis](mailto:pdebonis@purdue.edu).
