# Antiracist Reading List

This is the list of readings discussed in the Purdue math antiracism reading group. Numbered items have been read and discussed, while bulleted items have been suggested but not yet read. The items are presented in the order we read them, not in any order of importance. Most things on the list are worth reading. Note that inclusion on this list is not an endorsement of the ideas expressed in the work -- some items were included to give context to another work which provides opposing views.

If you are looking to get your feet wet, I recommend you start with book 1 and articles 2, 4, and 10. If you would like to join the discussion, see what we are doing [on the reading group homepage](/). If you have suggestions for additional readings, please send them to [our mailing list](mailto:mathantiracistreading@lists.purdue.edu).
